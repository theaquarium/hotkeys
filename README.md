# Leah's Hotkeys

Here's some AHK scripts I use.

## TopWindow.ahk

This one pins the current window on top. I believe I got this one from the internet.

## Symbols.ahk

This one uses keyboard shortcuts to let you type a bunch of math and other symbols. I wrote this one! Please credit me if you decide to use it.


Enjoy!
